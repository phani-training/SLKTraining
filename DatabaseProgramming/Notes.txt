What is a Database?
What is a table, rows and columns?
Points to remember while creating the tables:
Degrees of Normalization(Upto 3)
1. Create a table with atleast one column to have unique data (Primary key)
2. If a column's data is repeated very frequently, it could be separated into a new table and its reference be maintained in the current table. (Foreign key).One-to-many
3. If there is many to many relation(One author writes many books and each book may be written by multiple authors) then a separate link table could be created and mapped with the primary key columns of the first and second tables. 
There are 2 ways of creating objects in SQL server?
Using SSMS(IDE for working with databases)
Using QUERY->Text files with extension .sql and write SQL commands in it and execute it from the database. 
While installing SQL server, U should run 2 setups:
- Install SQL EXPRESS Edition(Free and community)
- Install SSMS(SQL SERVER MANAGEMENT STUDIO) which is the IDE for connecting to UR Databases. 
Use Windows Authentication as the Accessibility when U R Installing the database in UR Machine.
